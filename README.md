# Recipes App
The recipes & cooking app that every programmer's spouse asks them to make at some point.

See: https://jbrecipesapp.herokuapp.com/
(It's running on free heroku, so kinda slow to load)

### Background
This app was created as our cooking habits tend to involve using Gousto, until we've got bored with the current recipe selection.

Then we cancel the sub, and just buy the recipes we liked from the supermarket.

The problem here is - we noticed it takes a fair amount of effort to find the recipes we liked, copy the ingredients into google keep.

On top of this, we like to have our shopping lists categorised, e.g. 'vegetables, meat', which involves further effort.

Enter 'JBRecipesApp' a terrible Ruby app that took far longer to write than doing the above ever would.
